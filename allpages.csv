(Disability,"payments with respect to “IDEA Funding” (as such term is hereina n er de n ned) to be received by the District,","while part of Impact Aid Revenues pursuant to the Act, are excluded from the pledge for the Bonds because their",use is limited to speci n c purposes pursuant to federal law.). The policy reason for the federal government to make,payments pursuant to the Program arises generally from the fact that “federally connected students” adversely affect,a school district’s financial base because their parents or guardians do one or more of the following in the school,"districts in which such students are enrolled: pay no income taxes or vehicle license fees in their state of residence,",live on non-taxable federal property (which is the case with respect to the District because all of the property in the,"District is located on the Navajo Native American Indian Reservation), shop at stores that generate no taxes or work",on non-taxable federal land. The Program provides payments to school districts in lieu of these lost taxes to offset,the impact created by the federal government and to assist with the basic educational needs of their students.,School districts can receive funding from just one of the Program’s “sections” or from more than one section. The,Program’s sections generally are as follows:,"Payments for propergy — Enacted in the original legislation in 1950 for the Program, this section reimburses school",districts for the loss of taxable land to the federal government. The payment is in lieu of the taxes that would,normally be paid by the private landowner and is not based on the presence of children residing on the property.,Basic support payment — This section provides basic support for a number of different types of federally connected,"children, including those who have a parent in the uniformed services, reside on Indian lands as is the case with the","District, live or have parents who work on federal property, or live in federally subsidized low-rent housing projects.","Disabilip' payments — Indian land and military students with disabilities are eligible to receive additional funding to","be used in accordance with the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (“IDEA”). (As noted hereinabove,",funding under this section is not available for payment of the Bonds.),Payments to heavily impacted districts — Eligible districts include those that (l) are highly impacted with federal,students and have a higher than average tax rate and (2) have a below average spending rate per pupil when,"compared to similar districts. (After federal n scal year 200], this section was eliminated and amounts for this",purpose are combined with basic support payments.),Construction payment — This section addresses the construction and maintenance needs of certain districts.,Payments are based on a separate appropriations amount divided by the number of eligible students.,As summarized in TABLE 1 herein. basic support payments typically represent the bulk of appropriations under the,"Program. For instance. for the federal n scal year (October 1 through September 30) ending in 2003, $1.025 billion,",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

D. State Funding,1. Minimum Education Program,The largest portion of funding comes from the state and is accomplished,through annual appropriations by the legislature to meet the requirements of the state’s Minimum,Education Program (MEP). The MEP was established in 1953 and is codi n ed in Chapter 19 of Title,"37 of the Mississippi Code of 1972, as amended. The MEP will be in effect until July 1, 2002, at",which time the Mississippi Accountability and Adequate Education Program Act of 1997 (MAEP),will become n illy implemented and will replace the MEP. [See Section 4 below],The MEP is n nanced jointly by local contributions and the State of Mississippi.,The formula for determining the cost of the minimum education program in a given school district,and the amount paid by the State is set forth in the statutes authorizing the MEP.,2. State Public Schools Building Fund,The state also provides limited n inding assistance to school districts for capital,construction projects. A grant program was established in 1953 which has provided substantial,"assistance to local school districts over the last 30 years. The program, formerly administered by the","Education Finance Commission, is presently administered by the State Board of Education and is",known as the State Public Schools Building Fund (the Building Fund). The Building Fund is n inded,primarily through a n xed amount of annual n mding from sales tax revenues of the state. The Building,Fund is authorized to issue state bonds to produce n nds that are redistributed to local districts based,upon a formula allowing for credits for a certain dollar amount for each student for each year. A local,district is allowed to borrow against those credits in order to provide funding assistance for the,"facilities needed. However, a school district is not obligated to repay any portion of its allocation or",any portion of the underlying bonded indebtedness of the Building Fund.,3. State Public Schools Sales Tax Diversion,"During the 1992 legislative session, the State enacted a law which, among","other things, increased the sales tax in the state from six percent to seven percent with the bulk of the","increased sales tax revenues to be used for the bene n t of the State’s public schools. In particular, the",sales tax law creates the Education Enhancement Fund through which approximately Sixteen Million,"Dollars ($16,000,000) of sales tax revenues will be distributed to the State school districts on an",enrollment-based formula. The distributed funds may be used to pay the costs of capital,improvements or transportation equipment purchases or to pay debt service on debt issued to pay for,these purposes.

The total amount for the Program nationally (not including United States Department of Education owned facilities,and beginning in n scal year 2002 certain amounts available under the competitive construction provisions of the,Program) has been funded at the following levels during the past n ve federal n scal years:,TABLE 1,(Dollar amounts are in millions),On a 0/0,Basis for,Appropriation for 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 2003,Payments for Property 5 28.0 $ 32.0 S 40.5 $ 55.0 $ 59.6 5.2 %,"Basic Support Payments 704.0 737.0 882.0 982.5 1,025.3 88.9",Disability Payments‘ 50.0 50.0 50.0 50.0 50.6 4.4,"Payments to Heavily lmpacted Districts 70.0 72.0 -"" J“ J"" --",Construction Payments 7.0 7.0 6.0 18.0 17.8 1.5,"Total S 859.0 5 898.0 5 978.5 5 1,105.5 $ 1,153.3",Percent Increase 7.1% 4.5% 8.9% 12.9% 4.3% 100.0 °/o,"* As described hereinabove, n mding under this section for the District is not available for payment of the Bonds.","** For federal n scal year 2001 and thereafter, amounts for this section of the Program will be combined with",those for basic support payments.,Source: US. Department of Education and National Association of Federally Impacted Schools.,"According to information from the Department and the National Association of Federally Impacted Schools, in","federal n scal year 2003, for example, approximately 1,128,000 federally connected students were eligible for","funding under the Program and more than 1,275 school districts were impacted by federally connected students.","As noted hereinabove, Indian land students with disabilities are eligible for additional funding through the Program",in accordance with IDEA. The amount of additional funding earmarked for children with disabilities (“CWD”) is,allocated by totaling the eligible CWD weights in a school district and multiplying that amount by the amount per,"CWD student to be paid (the “IDEA Funding”). IDEA Funding must, however, pursuant to federal law be used",specifically for special education and therefore is deducted from the amount pledged pursuant to State law as,indicated hereinabove.,As noted hereinbelow under the heading “RISK FACTORS — Authorization in Federal Budget and Subsequent,"Appropriation; Changes in Funding Formula,” the full formula entitlement for the Program has not been",appropriated since 1968. Shortfalls in funding cause allocations to be made. Because there is not enough money to,"fund the total amount required for basic support payments, these payments are reduced on a needs basis, instead, for","instance, of simply being prorated. In this way, more funds are allocated to districts that are more n nancially",dependent upon the Program. Need is computed by adding together the percentage of federal students in a district,compared to the total enrollment and the percentage of the operating budget that the maximum basic support,payments represent compared to the total budget. The per-pupil basic support payment is multiplied by the sum of,"these two percentages, resulting in the LOT MOD described hereinabove. For example, during the last federal n scal","year, the Program received $1.025 billion for basic support payments. To fully fund the Program, it would have","taken an estimated $1.75 billion. A majority of the approximately 1,275 federally connected public school districts",nationwide therefore did not receive their maximum payment. As the LOT MOD prioritizes the distribution of,"Impact Aid Revenues to those school districts with the greatest need for such funding, Indian land districts that are",highly impacted such as the District have since n scal year 1999 received their maximum payments. (The District,LOT MOD for its most recent funding was 100% due to the large number of Indian land students.),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4. Mississippi Accountability and Adequate Education Program,"During the most recent legislative session (1997 Regular Session), the",Mississippi Legislature enacted the Mississippi Accountability and Adequate Education Program act,"of 1997 (MAEP), with an effective date of July 1, 1997. This legislation provides for a total overhaul",of the n nding formula for public education in Mississippi and will ultimately replace the MEP and,"the state's Uniform Millage Assistance Grant program (""equity n Jnding"" grants). The program will",be phased in over a n ve-year period pursuant to the following schedule and in the following amounts:,Additional Funding State-Wide,FY98 9.2% ($12 million),FY99 20% ($26.1 million),FY00 40% ($52.2 million),FY01 60% ($78.3 million),FY02 80% ($104.4 million),FY03 and annually thereafter 100% ($130.5 million),These funds will be distributed to each school district based upon a formula,"which includes such factors as local tax base, percentage of children “at-risk,” average daily",attendance and current levels of state funding. Under the formula all school districts are guaranteed,an increase in the current level of state funding per pupil. The amount of n mding received by a school,district in any year will be determined by multiplying the average cost of educating a student in a,Level 111 school district during the previous year (as determined by the State Department of,Education) times the district’s average daily attendance.,"During the phase-in period, local districts will receive a cumulative total of","$273 million in new state n mding. The use of these funds during the interim phase-in period,","however, is generally limited to capital improvement projects or repayment of other debt service. Up",to twenty percent may be utilized for instruction or technology purposes.,"Commencing July 1, 2002, the MAEP program will be n illy funded, and will",take the place of MEP as providing the primary source of n mding for school districts.,"Between October 1, 1997 and June 30, 1998, a school district may elect to",pledge future funding under the program of up to $160 per student to secure the issuance of State,"Aid Capital Improvement Bonds, and may also pledge all or a part of the funding it is to receive",during the n ve-year MAEP phase-in period to pay debt service on capital improvement debt issued,under existing statutes.,12,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The,Districts will covenant to levy taxes on all property in the respective district so that the levy will raise,"suf n cient funds to provide for the payment of principal of and interest on the Bonds, irrespective of the",amount of debt service reimbursement received from the State if either District becomes eligible in any,"future year. The amount of annual reimbursement will be subject to the amount appropriated biennially,","if any, by the State Legislature for this purpose and to the total amount of debt service reimbursement for",which all school districts in the State are annually eligible. If less is appropriated by the Legislature than,is needed to reimburse school districts for the full amount for which they are eligible (as such amount is,determined by a formula speci n ed under State law) the amount appropriated will be allocated pro rata to,eligible districts. No assurance can be given that this program of reimbursement will not be altered or,discontinued.

E. Local Sources,"The second source of n inding of public schools in Mississippi is from local sources,",primarily consisting of ad valorem tax revenues. The various types of local funding revenues may be,categorized as follows:,1. Limitations on School Tax Levies,All school districts in Mississippi are authorized to require the levy of an ad,valorem tax to provide necessary local n mding for operations. This is the primary source for a,"district's local sources revenues. Beginning with Fiscal Year 1998, the operational levy of all school","districts, excluding any debt service or other special debt levies, is limited to 55 mills. Any school","district which exceeded that levy as of July 1, 1997, however, shall be allowed an increase of up to","three mills between July 1, 1997, and June 30, 2002. Such increases are subject to the normal","increase limitations imposed on school districts of not more than 4 percent, in the discretion of the","board, or 7 percent, subject to a public referendum, if a proper petition is n led requesting such",referendum.,"On June 15, 1994, the case of Reeves v. State of Mississippi. et al., was filed in Hinds","County Chancery Court, Hinds County, Mississippi, whereby the Plaintiff seeks to enjoin the","imposition of ad valorem taxes for general maintenance and support of school districts or,","alternatively, to enjoin the imposition of the above-mentioned 4 percent mandatory increase on federal",and state constitutional grounds. The suit does not challenge the constitutionality of Section 37-59-,23 of the Mississippi Code which mandates the levy of an unlimited ad valorem tax for the payment,"of general obligation school bonds. On August 2, 1994, the Chancery Court denied the Plaintiff's",request for an injunction.,2.

The current","method of budgeting and n nancing operating and capital expenditures of school districts in Montana, as","described below, is the result of legislation adopted during a special session of the State’s legislature in","1993, as amended by the ensuing Legislative Sessions including the 2005 Legislative Session. and 2005",Special Legislative Session. This legislation was enacted in response to a State of Montana Supreme,Court ruling that found the previous system of school funding to be not in accordance with the State,Constitution. The stated legislative intent of the revised school funding laws was to create more equity,"in the budgets of Montana schools, more equity in the burden of Montana taxpayers for funding public",education and a funding formula that equitably distributes the State’s share of the costs for the basic,system. (See “Recent Changes in School District Funding” and “Litigation” herein.),The accounting systems of public school districts are organized on a fund basis. Each fund must be,"accounted for separately so that its resources, obligations, revenue and expenditures are kept apart from",other funds. A budgeted fund is a fund for which the Board of Trustees must of n cially adopt a budget in,"order to expend money from such fund. Currently, there are 11 budgeted n mds. Most discussion about",Montana school budgets and the budget process concentrates on the General Fund. The General Fund is,"used to n nance instructional, administrative, facility maintenance, and other operational costs of a",district not n nanced by other funds established for special purposes.,"The primary sources of funding for public education in the State of Montana are state, county and local",property tax levies. State and county levies are collected and allocated to districts on an equalized basis.,All districts receive direct state aid for a portion of their General Fund budget.

However, debt service expenditures, as well as expenditures related to compensated absences","and claims and judgements, are recorded only when the payment IS due.","Property taxes, franchise taxes, licenses, and interest associated with the current n scal period are all",considered to be susceptible to accrual and so have been recognized as revenues of the current n scal period.,All other revenue items are considered to be measurable an available only when cash is received by the,government.,The City reports the following major governmental funds:,"General Fund is the government's primary operating fund. It accounts _for all n nancial resources","of the general government, except those required to be accounted for In another fund.","State Tax Street Fund accounts for the maintenance, operation and construction of the City's",streets. The primary source of revenues is state shared highway funds.,Urban Renewal Project Fund accounts for the capital projects undertaken by the Agency. The,primary sources of revenue are loan proceeds and transfer from the Debt Sewice Fund.,Urban Renewal Debt Service Fund accounts for reserves and debt service to carry out the City’s,urban renewal plan. The primary source of revenue is property taxes.,The City reports the following major proprietary funds:,"Water Fund reports n nancial activity related to supply, treatment and distribution of water, with",the primary revenue coming from user fees.,Sewer Fund accounts for the resources and expenses related to collection and treatment of,wastewater. The primary source of revenue IS user fees.,Parbor Fund reports financial activity related to port facilities. Primary revenue is from moorage,ees.,As a general rule the effect of interfund activity has been eliminated from the government-wide financial,statements. Exceptions to this general rule are charges between the government’s proprietary funds and,various other functions of the government. Elimination of these charges would distort the direct costs and,program revenues reported for the various functions concerned.,"Amounts reported as program revenues include leases and rent income, capital grants, and contributions.",Internally dedicated resources are reported as general revenues rather than as pro ram revenues. General,"revenues include all taxes.

Operating revenues,and expenses generally result rom provrding services in connection with a proprie ary fund’s principal ongoing,operations. The principal operating revenues of the City’s enterprise fund are charges to customers for sales,"and serVices. Operating expenses for enterprise funds include the cost of sales and services, administrative","expenses, and depreciation on capital assets.

VI. LEGAL AND MISCELLANEOUS INFORMATION,A. No Default On Securities of the Issuer,No securities of the Issuer have been in default as to principal or interest payments,or in other material respects at any time in at least the last 25 years. No principal or interest on,any obligation of the Issuer is past due.,"No refunding securities have been'issued by the Issuer within the past 25 years for",the purpose of preventing a default in principal or interest payments on securities then outstanding.,B. Bond Proceeds For Current Operating Expenses,No proceeds from the sale of securities (except tax anticipation notes issued against,revenues of a current n scal year) have been used for current operating expenses of the Issuer at,any time in the last 10 years.,C. Constitutional Amendment,The quali n ed electors of the State of Mississippi voted in a general election held,"on November 7, 1995, to amend the Mississippi Constitution of 1890 (the ""Constitution"") to add","the following new Section 172A (the ""Amendment""):",SECTION 172A. Neither the Supreme Court nor any inferior court of this,state shall have the power to instruct or order the state or any political subdivision,"thereof, or an official of the state or any political subdivision, to levy or increase",taxes.,The Amendment does not affect the underlying obligation to pay the principal of,and interest on the Notes as they mature and become due nor does it affect the obligation to levy,"a tax suf n cient to accomplish that purpose. However, even though it appears that the Amendment","was not intended to affect Note holders' remedies in the event of a payment default, it potentially",prevents Note holders from obtaining a writ of mandamus to compel the levying of taxes to pay,the principal of and interest on the Notes in a court of the State of Mississippi. It is not certain,whether the Amendment would affect the right of a federal court to direct the levy of a tax to,satisfy a contractual obligation. Other effective remedies are available to the Note holders in the,"event of a payment default with respect to the Notes. For example, Note holders can seek a writ","of mandamus to compel the District's Board of Trustees or the Board of Aldermen of the City of","Aberdeen, Mississippi, to use any legally available moneys to pay the debt service on the Notes,","and if such writ of mandamus is issued and public of n cials fail to comply with such writ, then","such public of n cials may be held in contempt of court. In addition, pursuant to the Mississippi","Constitution § 175, all public of n cers who are guilty of willful neglect of duty may be removed",from office.,17,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
D. Homestead Exemption,"The homestead exemption law in Mississippi, known as ""The Homestead","Exemption Law of 1946, "" reduces the local tax burden on homes qualifying by law and substitutes",revenues from other sources of taxation on the state level as a reimbursement to the local taxing,units for such tax loss. Homes qualifying are exempt from certain types of ad valorem taxation,homestead exemption law determine,"up to an assessed valuation of $6,000. Provisions of the","qualification, define ownership and limit the amount of property that may come within the","exemption. The exemption is not applicable to taxes levied for the payment of the Notes, except",as hereafter noted.,Those homeowners who qualify for the homestead exemption and who have reached,exemption is,the age of sixty—five (65) years on or before January 1 of the year for which the,"claimed, and service-connected, totally disabled American veterans who were honorably",discharged from military service are exempt from any and all ad valorem taxes on qualifying,"homesteads not in excess of $6,000 of assessed value thereof.",As long as the ratio of total exempt assessed value to total assessed value of all,"realty does not exceed certain base year ratios, the tax loss resulting to local taxing units from",properly qualified homestead exemptions is reimbursed by the State Tax Commission to the,counties.,E. Legal Proceedings,There are no pending legal proceedings which might be expected to affect the,"Issuer's ability to perform its obligations to the holders of the Notes being offered for sale.",F. Validation,It is anticipated that the Notes will be validated by the Chancery Court of Monroe,"County, Mississippi as provided by Sections 31-13-1 through 31—13—1 1, Mississippi Code of 1972,",as amended.,G. Approval of Legal Proceedings,All legal matters in connection with the authorization and issuance of the Notes are,"subject to the unquali n ed opinion of Bond Counsel, Adams and Reese, LLP, of Jackson, Missis—",sippi.

certi n cate is accompanied by an opinion of nationally recognized bond counsel to the effect that such,application will not cause interest on the Bonds to be includable in gross income for federal income tax,purposes; and,"(iii) In each month during the 12-month period preceding the n nal maturity date of the Bonds, moneys held",in the Debt Service Reserve Fund will be credited against the payments otherwise due under the Bonds in,"respect of principal of and redemption premium, if any, and interest on the Bonds and shall be transferred to","the Impact Aid Revenue Bond Debt Service Fund for the payment of such principal, redemption premium and","interest; provided, however, that no such credit will be given and no such transfer will be made if and to the","extent that, immediately prior to such crediting and transfer, the amount on deposit in the Debt Service","Reserve Fund is not at least equal to the required amount, less the amounts previously transferred to the fund",during such 12-month period pursuant to this subparagraph (iii).,RISK FACTORS,The payment of the debt service on the Bonds will be dependent upon receipt of amounts of Impact Aid Revenues,pursuant to the Program by or on behalf of the District. Anyone considering investing in the Bonds should carefully,examine this Of n cial Statement with respect to such matters as well as the other topics discussed herein.,Authorization In Federal Budget and Subsequent Appropriation; Changes in Funding Formula.,Payment of amounts pursuant to the Program is subject to periodic reauthorization and to annual,appropriation. If the Program is not reauthorized or suf n cient appropriations not provided or if the same do,"not occur on a timely basis, there may not be amounts paid pursuant to the Program in suf n cient amounts or",on time to pay the principal of and interest on the Bonds as it becomes due.,"Congress must typically reauthorize the Program, including funding for the Program, every n ve years. Thereafter,",during each year of the n ve-year cycle Congress must appropriate funds for the Program and the President must then,"approve Congress’ appropriation. Unlike other federal programs, the Program is not “forward funded,” i.e., it must",be funded in the same n scal year as amounts are appropriated; funding of the previous year’s appropriation does not,guarantee funding in the current n scal year whether or not an appropriation bill has been passed by Congress and,approved by the President. This lack of “forward funding” can result in delays at either the authorization or,appropriation stage of the process.,"Between 1951 and 2003, the Program has been reauthorized nn een times, including the most recent reauthorization",in 2002. The current authorization runs through federal n scal year 2007. As a result of the language contained in,"the federal act which provided for the most recent reauthorization, a one-year automatic extension will occur at the","end of federal n scal year 2007 should Congress take no action on reauthorization. As such, the Program is currently","authorized (subject, however, to annual appropriation by Congress) through federal n scal year 2008.","With respect to major legislation such as the Elementary and Secondary Education Act (“ESEA”), of which funding","of the Program was most recently a part, Congress may delay reauthorization from n scal year to n scal year while","working on the related legislation. For example, in federal n scal year 2002 reauthorization was delayed while","ESEA was reviewed, and payments under the Program were delayed as a result.","As indicated in the following graph, over the 52-year history of the Program, funding has at times been reduced.","Ten times since 1950, the annual amount appropriated to the Program by Congress has been less than that provided",during the respective previous year. Until 1969 (the n rst year in which the amount appropriated was less than the,"preceding year), the Program was fully funded each year (suf n cient n mds to provide all districts their maximum","payment). In 1969, military spending priorities led to a 2.4% reduction in the Program. The largest decline in year-",over-year appropriations occurred in 1983 when a 37.5% decline culminated three consecutive years of falling,appropriations. It was not until 1994 that the total appropriation reestablished the 1979 peak of $786 million. In the,"Program's history. the greatest n ve-year drop was 43% (19774982), while the greatest ten-year drop was 25%",( 1972-1982).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A portion of,"such interest that accrues to the owner of such Bonds in each year, as described below, is, however,",included in the calculation for purposes of determining a corporate taxpayer’s alternative minimum tax and,environmental tax and may result in some of the collateral federal income tax consequences described,"above in the year of accrual. Consequently, owners of such Discount Bonds should be aware that the",accrual of original issue discount in each year may result in an alternative minimum tax liability;,environmental tax liability or other collateral federal income tax consequences although the owner may not,have received cash in such year. Original issue discount on such Discount Bonds will accrue over the term,ofa Discount Bond at a constant interest rate. A purchaser who acquires a Discount Bond at an issue price,equal to the initial offering price thereof as set fotth on the cover page of this Of n cial Statement for the,Bonds will be treated as receiving an amount of interest excludable from gross income for federal income,tax purposes equal to the original issue discount accruing during the period such purchaser holds the,"Discount Bonds, and will increase its adjusted basis in such Discount Bond by the amount of such accruing",discount for purposes of determining taxable gain or loss on the sale or other disposition of such Discount,"Bond. The federal income tax consequences of the purchase, ownership and redemption, sale or other",disposition of Discount Bonds which are not purchased in the initial offering at the initial offering price,may be determined according to rules which differ from those described above. Owners of Discount,Bonds should consult their own tax advisors with respect to the precise determination for federal income,"tax purposes of interest accrued upon sale, redemption or other disposition of Discount Bonds and with",respect to the sale and local tax consequences of owning and disposing ofDiscount Bonds.,RATING,Standard & Poor’s Rating Group has assigned their municipal bond rating of AA to the Bonds,"with the understanding that upon delivery of the Bonds, the standard policy of municipal bond insurance",insuring the timely payment of the principal and interest on the Bonds will be issued by Asset Guaranty,Insurance Company. The rating reflects only the views of said rating agency and an explanation of the,rating may be obtained only from said rating agency. There is no assurance that such rating will continue,"for any given period of time or that it will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by the rating agency, if in","their judgment, circumstances so warrant. A downward change in or withdrawal of any such rating, may","have an adverse effect on the market price of the Bonds.

The State advance or reimbursement amount is equal to the difference between the eligible district’s mill,divided by the,value per Budget Limit ANB and the statewide Facility Guaranteed Mill Value per ANB,statewide Facility Guaranteed Mill Value per ANB and multiplied by the lesser of (a) the annual debt,service obligation of the district for qualifying indebtedness or (b) the District’s school facility,"entitlement. As of the 2003 Legislative Session, the school facility entitlement for an elementary district",is calculated by adding the aggregate of (1) $300 per kindergarten through sixth grade student (up from,"$220 prior to July 1, 2003) and (2) $370 per seventh and eighth grade student (up from $270 prior to","July 1, 2003). The school facility entitlement for a high school district is $450 per high school student","(up from $330 prior to July 1, 2003).",The amount available for State advance and reimbursement is subject to appropriation by the State,"Legislature at its biennial legislative sessions.

If less than the total amount of reimbursement to eligible districts is available after payment of,"the State advance for school facilities, then each district will receive an amount of the available funds",which is proportional to the amount for which it is eligible to the total amount for which all districts are,eligible.,The State will distribute the advance or reimbursement for school facilities by May 31 to each eligible,n scal,district for purposes of reducing the property tax for the Debt Service Fund for the ensuing school,for calculating the,year. The Of n ce of Public Instruction (“OPI”) of the State of Montana is responsible,amount of advance and reimbursement and distributing the advance and reimbursement to each eligible,district. OPI estimates that for n scal year 2006/07 approximately 100% of the total reimbursement,amount for eligible districts will be available to districts given the appropriation by the legislature for,The,n scal year 2006/07 and the number of districts that currently qualify for advance or reimbursement.,"2005/06 pro-rata appropriation for reimbursement payments was 81.25%, the 2004/05 pro-rata",appropriation was 82.25% and the 2003/04 pro-rata appropriation was 95.03%.,The Elementary District is currently eligible to receive reimbursement from the State of Montana for a,"portion of its annual debt service requirements relating to the Elementary District Bonds, because for",statewide,n scal year 2006/07 the mill value per ANB for the Elementary District (6.74) is less than the,Facility Guaranteed Mill Value per ANB (25.96) for elementary districts according to the Montana,"Of n ce of Public Instruction. Pursuant to State law, the High School District is currently eligible to",receive reimbursement from the State of Montana for a portion of its annual debt service requirements,"relating to the High School District Bonds, because for n scal year 2006/07 the mill value per ANB for",the High School District (14.92) is less than the statewide Facility Guaranteed Mill Value per ANB,(51.21) for high school districts according to the Montana Of n ce of Public Instruction. The Districts,suf n cient,will covenant to levy taxes on all property in the respective district so that the levy will raise,"funds to provide for the payment of principal of and interest on the Bonds, irrespective of the amount of","debt service reimbursement received from the State, if any. No assurance can be given that this program","of reimbursement will not be altered or discontinued.

Elections,"For Montana schools, there are different types of elections for different tax—related purposes.","Historically these have been General Fund elections to increase “OverBASE” tax levy, General Fund","elections to adopt a budget that exceeds the “Maximum General Fund Budget”, elections to sell bonds,",and elections for a building reserve fund tax levy. The 2001 Legislative Session set into place the,"technology fund tax levy election, which provides a new revenue source for school districts allowing",money that was formerly allocated for this purpose in the General Fund to come from other sources.,"With the exception of the General Fund elections, which are annual levy elections held on the n rst","Tuesday after the n rst Monday in May, all of the other elections described above can be held at any time",and there is no restriction on running the elections more than one time as long as the proper election,procedures are followed.,"Valuations, Assessments and Reassessment of Property for Taxation Purposes","General. As a general rule, all real and personal property in the State of Montana is: subject to taxation","by the State and its counties, municipalities and other political subdivisions to n nance various general",and special governmental functions. This rule is subject to exceptions in the case of speci n ed classes of,"exempt property, including public property, property of churches, schools, hospitals, cemeteries and","charities, household goods, certain agricultural products, automobiles, smaller trucks, business","inventory, money and credits. Property is classi n ed according to its use and character, and the different",classes of property are taxed at different percentages of their market valuation.,"All taxable property except farmland and mines is to be assessed at 100 percent of market value, as such",market value is determined by the Montana Department of Revenue (the “Department of Revenue”). In,"practice, market value is generally less than the property’s appraised value for resale purposes. The",Montana Constitution requires that property tax values be equalized across the State. The Department of,Revenue administers and supervises a program for the revaluation of all taxable property within classes,Calculation of Taxable Value”,"three, four and ten property pursuant to a written plan. (See “Tax Rates —","herein for discussion of classi n cations for property tax purposes).

The resulting",valuation changes must be phased in each year until the next reappraisal at a rate of 16.66% per year,unless otherwise speci n ed. Other property valuations are based on comprehensive appraisals of all,taxable property performed by the Department of Revenue each year. The Department of Revenue is,required by law to furnish market and taxable values to each taxing jurisdiction prior to the n rst Monday,in August for purposes of preparing n scal year budgets.,The heavy reliance on property tax as the source of funding for local governments and public school,systems resulted in the late 19805 and through the 19905 in numerous attempts both legislative and,through voter initiated legislative initiatives and constitutional amendments to limit the property tax.,Montana local governments have been subject to a legislatively imposed property tax limitation since,"1986.

The transition liability is maintained separately from the SLGRP, and is reduced",by contributions and increased for interest charges at the assumed interest rate.,The contribution rate adjustment attributable to a transition liability or surplus is determined by amortizing the,liability or surplus on the valuation date over a fixed period and expressing the result as a percentage of,"combined Tier One/Tier Two and OPSRP payroll.

TAX EXEMPTION,"In the opinion of Bond Counsel, under existing laws, regulations, rulings and judicial decisions, and assuming","compliance with certain restrictions, conditions and requirements by the District as described below, interest income",on the Bonds will be excluded from gross income for federal income tax purposes and will be exempt from State of,Arizona income taxes. The opinion of Bond Counsel will be dated as of the date of delivery of the Bonds. The form,"of such opinion is included as APPENDIX C attached hereto,","The Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), imposes various restrictions, conditions and",requirements relating to the continued exclusion of interest income on the Bonds from gross income for federal,income tax purposes. The District has covenanted to comply with the provisions of the Code relating to such,"matters. The District’s failure to comply with such restrictions, conditions and requirements could result in the","interest income on the Bonds being included as gross income for federal income tax purposes, under certain","circumstances, from the date of issuance. The Bonds do not provide for an adjustment in the interest rate or",payment amount in the event of taxability and the event of taxability does not cause an acceleration of principal of,the Bonds or the payment amount of the Certi n cates. The opinion of Bond Counsel assumes compliance with such,covenants.,The Code also imposes an “alternative minimum tax” (“AMT”) upon certain corporations and individuals. The,AMT is equal to the excess (if any) of a taxpayer’s “tentative minimum tax” for a taxable year over its regular,income tax liability for the taxable year. The tentative minimum tax is based upon a taxpayer’s “alternative,minimum taxable income” (“AMTI”). A taxpayer’s AMTI is its taxable income with certain adjustments. Interest,income on the Bonds is not an item of tax preference to be included in the AMT] of individuals or corporations.,"Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, included in the adjustments of AMTI for corporations is an adjustment",increasing the corporation‘s AMTI by seventy- n ve percent (75%) of the excess (if any) of the corporation‘s,“adjusted current earnings” over the corporation’s AMTI for the taxable year (determined without regard to such,adjustment for excess adjusted current earnings and the alternative tax net operating loss deduction). A,"corporation’s “adjusted current earnings” will include all its tax-exempt interest, including the interest on the Bonds.","Although Bond Counsel will render an opinion that, as of the initial delivery of the Bonds, interest income on the","Bonds is excluded from gross income for federal income tax purposes, the accrual or receipt of interest on the Bonds","may otherwise affect a Bondholder's federal tax liability. Certain taxpayers may experience other tax consequences.","Taxpayers purchasing the Bonds, including, without limitation, corporations subject to the branch pro n ts tax,","n nancial institutions, certain insurance companies, certain subchapter S corporations, individuals who receive Social",Security or Railroad Retirement bene n ts and taxpayers who have or are deemed to have incurred indebtedness to,purchase or carry tax-exempt obligations should consult their tax consultants as to the applicability of such tax,consequences to the respective Taxpayer. The nature and extent of these other tax consequences will depend upon,the Taxpayer’s particular tax status and the Taxpayer’s other items of income or deduction. Bond Counsel expresses,no opinion regarding any such other tax consequences.,The Bonds are not “private activity bonds” within the meaning of Section 141 of the Code.,"Under existing federal tax law, if the Bonds are determined to be invalid for failure to comply with a substantive or","procedural requirement of local law, the Bonds will be deemed not to be an Obligation of the District and interest on",the Bonds will not be excludable from gross income for federal income tax purposes. The Bonds do not provide for,"an adjustment in interest rate or yield in the event of taxability, and an event of taxability does not cause an",acceleration of the principal of the Bonds.,"From time to time, there are legislative proposals in Congress which, if enacted could alter or amend the federal tax",matters referred to above or adversely affect the market value of the Bonds. It cannot be predicted whether or in,"what form any such proposal might be enacted or whether, if enacted. it would apply to obligations (such as the",Bonds) issued prior to enactment.,22,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"CITY OF DEPOE BAY, OREGON","NOTES TO THE SCHEDULES OF THE CITY'S PROPORTIONATE SHARE",OF THE NET PENSION LIABILITY (ASSET) AND CONTRACTUALLY REQUIRED,"CONTRIBUTIONS for the Year Ended June 30, 2015",Changes in Plan Provisions Subsequent to Measurement Date,"On April 30, 2015, the Oregon Supreme Court ruled in Moro vs. State of Oregon that the provisions of Senate","Bill 861, signed into law in October of 2013, that limited the post-retirement COLA on benefits accrued prior to","the signing of the law was unconstitutional. Bene n ts could be modified prospectively, but not retrospectively. As","a result, those who retired before the bills were passed will continue to receive a COLA tied to the Consumer",Price Index that normally results in a 2% increase annually. PERS members who accrued bene n ts both before,and after the effective dates of the 2013 legislation will have a blended COLA rate when they retire. The System,will be required to make payments to those members who received bene n ts between the date of enactment of,the legislation and the Oregon Supreme Court decision to restore the amounts that should have been paid.

This change will allow PERS to use the same cost method contribution rate calculations as,required for financial reporting under GASB Statements 67 and 68.,"In combination with the change in cost method, the PERS Board chose to re-amortize the outstanding Tier One/","Tier Two UAL as of December 31, 2013 over a closed period of 20 years as a level percentage of projected",payroll gains and losses between subsequent rate-setting valuations to be amortized over a closed 20 year,period from the valuation in which they were first recognized.,"Also in combination with the change in cost method, the “grade-in range” over which the rate collar gradually",doubles was modi n ed so that the collar doubles as funded status (excluding side accounts) decreases from 70%,to 60% or increases from 130% to 140%.

Single Audit Report on Internal Control Structure,Paqe 2,The management of the Aberdeen School District is responsible for,establishing and maintaining an internal control Structure. In,"fulfilling this responsibility, estimates and judgments by",management are required to assess the expected benefits and related,costs of internal control structure policies and procedures. The,objectives of an internal control structure are to provide,"management with reasonable, but not absolute, assurance that assets","are safeguarded against loss from unauthorized use or disposition,",that transactions are executed iJl accordance with nmnagement’s,authorization and recorded properly to permit the preparation of,general purpose financial statements in accordance with generally,"accepted accounting principles, and that federal financial",assistance programs are managed in compliance with applicable laws,and regulations. Because of inherent limitations in any internal,"control structure, errors, irregularities, or instances of","noncompliance may nevertheless occur and not be detected. Also,",projection of any evaluation of the structure to future periods is,subject to the risk that procedures may become inadequate because,of changes in conditions or that the effectiveness of the design,and operation of policies and procedures may deteriorate.,"For the purpose of this report, we have classified the significant",internal control structure policies and procedures used in,administering federal financial assistance programs in the follow—,ing categories:,I. GENERAL REQUIREMENTS,Political Activity,Davis~Bacon Act,Civil Rights,Cash Management,Federal Financial Reports,Allowable Costs/Cost Principles,Administrative Requirements,II.

"issued on April 15, 2004, the District Court held that the State’s system of funding public education","violates the Montana Constitution in that, among other things, it fails to provide adequate n inding for","Montana public schools. By an Order dated on or about November 9, 2004 and an Opinion dated","March 22, 2005, the Montana Supreme Court af n nned the District Court’s Order that the public school","funding system violates Article X, Section 1(3) of the Montana Constitution by failing to provide","adequate funding. The effective date of the District Court’s Order, as af n rmed by the Montana Supreme",the,"Court, was October 1, 2005, in order to provide the Montana Legislature an opportunity to remedy",constitutional in n rmity. The Order of the District Court provided that “[p]rior to the expiration of that,"date [October 1, 2005], all existing contractual obligations and bonded indebtedness of the public school",districts in Montana shall in no way be affected by this Court’s decision.”,The Legislature in its regular session in 2005 enacted legislation addressing some of the concerns raised,by the Court and in a special session in December 2005 enacted legislation to provide additional funding,"for public schools, commencing with the n scal year ending June 30, 2007. (See “Montana School",Changes in School District Funding” and “Operating,District Financing and Budgeting - Recent,Legislative Session”). The legislation did not change the method of,Expenditures and Budgeting — 2005,n nancing capital improvements by school districts or appropriate additional funds to school districts in,"respect of capital facilities, other than $23 million to pay for costs of weatheiization or deferred",maintenance in each district. The legislation did authorize a condition and needs assessment and energy,audit of K-12 public school facilities to be completed and presented to the appropriate committee of the,"Legislature by July 1, 2008.",The District Court in the Columbia Falls Litigation reserved in its Order the right to exercise continuing,"jurisdiction over the case so as to avoid unnecessary, costly delays and complications. Pursuant to a","joint motion and stipulation of the parties, the District Court on January 4, 2006, issued an Order stating",that the District Court’s determination of the unconstitutionality of the State’s public school funding,"system, as af n rmed by the Montana Supreme Court, “shall not in any way affect the validity of any","bond, warrant, indenture, security, or other obligation issued and negotiated for purposes authorized by","law by the State of Montana, any county, or any school district issued after the effective date of the","Court’s Order (October 1, 2005) or use of the proceeds thereof.”","On June 13, 2006, the plaintiffs in the litigation n led a Motion for Supplemental Relief and an Order to","Show Cause, requesting that the District Court set a show cause hearing in May or June 2007, in which",hearing the State of Montana would be required to show cause why further relief should not be granted.,"The plaintiffs argue that although the Legislature has de n ned what “quality” education is, it has not","appropriated funding to meet this standard, in that, among other things, the legislature has not made","funding decisions on empirical analysis of a “quality” education, but has instead based its decisions on",political considerations. The State of Montana n led a response to the plaintiffs’ motion on,"June 26, 2006, alleging that the legislation enacted during the 2005 Regular and Special Legislative","Sessions ful n lled the Courts’ mandate, and that further review in the current case is moot given that the",current public school funding system is materially different than the one originally challenged in the,"lawsuit, and that any challenge to the current public school funding system or the one in existence",following the 2007 Legislative Session should take the form of a new law suit. The District Court has,not yet issued an order on the motion and response and the timing of such an order is unknown. It is not,possible to predict the effect that the District Court’s decision on this matter will have on validity of the,funding of capital improvements by school districts.,33,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
